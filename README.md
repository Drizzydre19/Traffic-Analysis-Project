# Traffic-Analysis-Project
Project Background Information.
All road traffic accidents involving casualties are logged and reported in Great Britain, along
with (probably) a majority of other non-fatal road traffic accidents. Every year, the government
releases a large batch of data associated with these reports. In this project, I will be using the data
from 2020.
